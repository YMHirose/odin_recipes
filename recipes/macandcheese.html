                <ol>
                    <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                        Cook and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; 
                        season with salt and pepper. 
                        Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until onions are browned, 
                        10 to 15 minutes. 
                        Transfer to a plate and discard the bay leaf. 
                        Reserve the skillet.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
                        Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
                        until tender yet firm to the bite, 
                        about 8 minutes
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium heat. 
                        Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and bring to a boil; 
                        season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. 
                        Reduce heat and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes. 
                        Stir in Gruyere cheese until melted.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce 
                        until well combined.
