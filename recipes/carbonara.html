            Description
        </h2>
            <p>
                is an Italian pasta dish from Rome 
                made with eggs, hard cheese, cured pork, and black pepper. 
                The dish arrived at its modern form, with its current name, 
                in the middle of the 20th century.
                The cheese is usually Pecorino Romano, Parmigiano-Reggiano, or a combination of the two.
                Spaghetti is the most common pasta, but fettuccine, rigatoni, linguine, or bucatini are also used.
                Normally guanciale or pancetta are used for the meat component,
                but lardons of smoked bacon are a common substitute outside Italy.

                    Steps

                    <ol>
                        <li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large, heavy frying pan over medium heat. 
                            Add pancetta and garlic; 
                            saute until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. 
                            Remove from the heat and cool slightly.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whisk cream, Parmesan, egg yolks, basil, and 
                            parsley together in a large bowl until well blended.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Stir chicken into the pancetta mixture until combined. 
                            Add cooked spaghetti and cream mixture. 
                            Toss over medium-low heat until chicken is heated through and 
                            sauce forms a thick coating over the spaghetti, about 4 minutes. 
                            Do not boil or the eggs will scramble. 
                            Season with salt and pepper and transfer to a large, 
                            wide serving bowl.
                        </li>
